            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Not many cities in the world are as captivating as <b>Nairobi, Kenya</b>. The Nairobi city has it all – from delicious food to breathtaking landscapes, Kenya safaris and the warmest people you’ll meet on your travels. If you’re thinking of visiting Nairobi, it’s time to start making plans <b>Nairobi</b> is the capital and largest city in Kenya. <b>Nairobi city</b> has grown from a rail depot in 1899 to a city of millions. It is the business, finance, and cultural hub of Kenya. Most <b>Kenya safari</b>-bound visitors in Kenya spend at least one night in Nairobi, which is known as the “Safari Capital of the World”. However, many travelers spend little if any time actually exploring the city itself. The Nairobi is often used just as a place to stay before or after a flight rather than as a destination to explore. We think there are two main reasons that people don’t explore Nairobi. One is lack of time. Many plans a packed safari schedule focused on wildlife viewing with no time set aside to explore Nairobi. The second is fears related to safety and crime. Nairobi isn’t the safest city in the world, but you can safely explore the city if you take precautions. Nairobi has a lot of visitor attractions, including museums, wildlife attractions, markets, cultural performances, parks, hiking trails, and great dining options. If you are interested in history, African art, wildlife, music, hiking, food, crafts, trains, gardens, or shopping, you are sure to find something of interest to do and see in the city. It is also a city where you can really learn about Kenya, whether you are interested in colonial history, Kenyan independence, or modern life in Kenya’s capital city. From the ritzy suburbs to the busy Central Business District to Africa’s largest slum area, Nairobi is a multi-faceted city worth exploring. To help you, We have put together this Nairobi travel guide of the best things to see, do and experience in Nairobi, Kenya. You are reading: A Travel Guide to Nairobi
            </p>
            <h2>Getting to Nairobi</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The main way that most international visitors get to Nairobi is by flying into the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO), Kenya’s main international airport. But you can also reach Nairobi by train, car, or bus. By Plane The main airport in Nairobi is Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO). It is likely that this is where you’ll be arriving into Kenya. if you are arriving from elsewhere in Kenya or East Africa, your flight may arrive at the smaller <b>Nairobi Wilson Airport in Nairobi</b>. To get from the Nairobi airport to your Nairobi Apartments, you can take a taxi, a shared shuttle bus, an Uber, or book a private transfer, we recommend booking your airport transfer in advance as it tends to be the most hassle-free way. If you decide to take a taxi, be sure to set a clear price with the driver before agreeing to the trip. Or consider booking an Uber in advance. By Train Currently, the railway system in Kenya only connects a small area of Kenya, mainly the cities of Nairobi and <b>Mombasa</b>. So, the main travelers arriving by train into Nairobi are those who are arriving into Mombasa by plane or ship. Historically, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya were connected by train but the rail connections have been closed for many years.
            </p>
            <h2>Nairobi Taxis and Ride Sharing Apps</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              <b>Nairobi Taxis</b> and ride shares are very popular ways for visitors to get around Nairobi. Although more expensive than public transit, these tend to be easier, safer, and more comfortable. <b>Taxis in Nairobi</b> can usually be found waiting at the airports, train stations, street corners in the city center, and also around popular hotels, tourist sites, and shopping centers. Licensed taxis in Nairobi are either yellow or marked with a yellow stripe. Just note that many don’t use meters so you will want to agree on a price before you get in the taxi.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Nairobi Weather </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The average annual temperature is around 66° F (18.5° C). Daytime temperatures rarely go below 50° F (10° C) or above 85° F (29° C). February and March are typically the hottest months in Nairobi with an average temperature of 69° F (20.5° C) and the coldest months are July and August with an average temperature of 62° F (16.5°C). Kenya has two rainy seasons, from March to May and from October to December. The rainiest month is April with a lot of rain also typical in May and November. So, you’ll definitely want to be prepared for rain if visiting during the rainy season, but we’d recommend being prepared for rain no matter when you visit. Nairobi is a city you can visit any time of the year. The weather is pretty temperate throughout the year, being warm during the days and cool at night. Most attractions in the city are open year-round to visitors.
            </p>
            <h2>How to Dress in Nairobi</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              We recommend wearing comfortable clothing in Nairobi that are suitable for the weather. It is often sunny in Nairobi so be sure to protect yourself from the sun and check the weather forecast for rain. It is important to respect the local culture and customs while in Kenya, which means wearing clothing that is more loose-fitting and conservative. This means avoiding really tight-fitting clothing or clothes that are short, show off your stomach, or expose a lot of skin. However, although Kenyans may wear more conservative styles, they love color and bold patterns! Now, while safari clothing and hiking boots are great to wear when on safari or hiking, we don’t recommend wearing those clothes when visiting Nairobi (unless you are going to Nairobi National Park). We recommend wearing your regular travel clothes and leaving your safari clothing in your suitcase while exploring the city.
            </p>
            <h2>Nairobi National Park</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              <b>Nairobi National Park</b> is unique as it is the only wildlife park located within a capital city. It is located just 10 km south of the downtown area of Nairobi. It is one of the few places in the world where you can spot animals with a city landscape in the background. Although a somewhat compact park, it has over 100 species of mammals. It has 4 of the Big Five animals; the park does not have any elephants. It has many of the animals that people come to Kenya to see, including lions, leopards, giraffes, zebra, cheetah, hyenas, rhinos, hippos, impala, baboons, and crocodiles. Over 400 bird species have been recorded here. If you plan to visit the park, we recommend going early and visiting in the morning. Many of the animals and birds are more active in the cooler morning hours. You can obviously see more if you have a full day. But if you just have half a day for visiting, we recommend choosing the morning rather than the afternoon to visit. You can drive your own vehicle or hire a guide. We highly recommend going with a driver guide who knows the park and in a proper safari vehicle with a pop-up roof. A good guide can really help you see more and better identify the animals and birds you do see.

              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Nairobi National Museum is a great general museum to visit while in the city. The museum has been around in some form for over 100 years, first set up in colonial Kenya by the British. It carried on after independence and has been expanded and updated over the years. It is the flagship museum of the National Museums of Kenya. The museum has a number of different galleries that each focus on a theme such as Kenyan history, mammals, birds of East Africa, cultural anthropology, human evolution, money, art, and musical instruments. There are also changing temporary exhibitions. A couple of displays that international visitors often know about are the skeleton of Ahmed the elephant (one of the most famous elephants in the world) and the Joy Adamson Gallery (known for her book Born Free and the movie of the same name).

              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <b>Carnivore</b> is by far the most well-known restaurant in Nairobi and has become a popular tourist destination. It was opened in Nairobi in 1980 and offers an all-you-can-eat menu that is focused on roasted meats. <b>Carnivore restaurant</b> became famous for serving some pretty unusual and exotic wild game meats, but because wild game meat has since been outlawed in Kenya, all meat served here is now farmed. So you’ll be offered typical meats like steak, leg of lamb, pork, and chicken, but there are also more unusual meats on offer like ostrich, crocodile, and bull testicles.
              </p>
